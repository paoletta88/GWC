<h1>Yes, security is important</h1>

			Some emails that you receive have a trusted digital signature, some dont. An email with a trusted digital signature has this icon:
				<br>
				<img src="./images/secure_certificate.png">
			<br>

				Are your emails digitally signed? If yes, great, if not go install the certificate so that when you send an email, it has the badge as in the image.
			<br>
			How do I install the certificate? Well, this is a great time to use Google :)
			<br>
	<br>

			This level is easy. As a solution to this level do the following:
			<br>

			1. Block as spam email address nick.ferruolo@ge.com
			<br>			2. Send an email to paola.garufi@ge.com with certified signature with the below information
			<br>

			<strong>Subject</strong>: Team "TeamName" reached level 4
			<br>
			<strong>Content</strong>: Please attach a print screen shot to show nick.ferruolo@ge.com is set as spam
			<br>

				<br>
			Remember, if your email does not have a security signature on it, you will not have qualified this level.
